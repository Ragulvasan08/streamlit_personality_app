# Personality Disorder Prediction Web App

Welcome to the Personality Disorder Prediction Web App! This interactive tool leverages machine learning to predict personality types and the presence of borderline personality disorder based on user-provided text. Built using Streamlit, this app provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for making these predictions.

## 🎯 Features

- **Login Page**: Securely access the app's features with a simple login interface.
- **Input Page**: 
  - Enter text and choose a machine learning model for prediction.
  - Form validation ensures that text meets the criteria and provides real-time feedback.
  - Navigate easily with a "Go Back" button to return to the login page.
  - Supports form submission via both "Submit" button and "Enter" key.
- **Output Page**: 
  - View the prediction results, including personality type and disorder status.
  - Get detailed insights based on the selected model (Decision Tree or Random Forest).
